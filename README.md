# Fetch Recap Task

To complete a fetch request task, I decided to build a movie website. It helps my children see quickly what is on at the cinema.

I learned a lot about making API calls and displaying data using the documentation from the API site. 

There were a number of blockers I faced whilst making this and used help from mentors and coaches to help me get through these.

It reminds me how resilience and initiative are key skills when learning a new skill.

I am currently remaking this site using NextJS to see the difference and remind me how much I have learned on the bootcamp in 16 weeks.
